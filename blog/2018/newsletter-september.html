<p>Hello Chicago!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Can you believe that September is here already? That means you only have a few more weeks to wring every last bit of fun out of the nice warm weather before winter sets in. We’ve been keeping busy here at CJUG World Headquarters, so let’s get right to it.</p>

<h3 id="_java_news">Java News</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="http://www.java-countdown.xyz/">The countdown to the Java 11 release</a> on September 25th has started. This will be the Long Term Support version, meaning it will get security and stability patches for three years. If you’ve been reluctant to upgrade to Java 9 or 10, consider checking out 11, it will be around for a while, even after 12 comes out. Major features of Java 11 are an official HTTP client, some bytecode changes to make future features possible, local variable syntax for lambda parameters, as well as moving Java EE and CORBA packages out of the standard distribution. Give it a try, let us know what you think!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Speaking of Java 11, are you having trouble figuring out what Long Term Support really means, and what the latest news on free vs. paid support is? You aren’t alone. Stephen Colebourne, the person who brought us Joda Time as well as the JSR-310 spec lead has <a href="https://blog.joda.org/2018/08/java-is-still-available-at-zero-cost.html">a great blog post explaining your options</a>.</p>

<p><strong>REST Beyond the Obvious - API Design for Ever Evolving Systems</strong><br>
Thursday, September 20 at Blue Cross Blue Shield</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>a.k.a. RESTBTO-ADFEES. Rolls off the tongue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/olivergierke">Oliver Gierke</a> is coming all the way from Dresden, Germany to present this talk and it’s one we think you’ll really learn a lot from. The talk takes a step back and looks at the architectural context APIs live in and outlines the drawbacks that result from ignoring crucial parts of REST. It discusses internal vs. external APIs, whether that distinction is useful in the first place, the impact of Domain-Driven Design and how to design and specify APIs and their clients to optimize for evolvability so that changes in an API don’t break clients.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Oliver was gracious enough to offer the community a choice in what he presented and this was the winner of the vote! So if you voted, thank you!</p>

<p><strong>Office Hours</strong><br>
Monday. September 17 at IBM</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Got a project you need help with? New to Java and want some concepts explained, or help sorting out all of your options? Want to just come hang out and code? Come to CJUG Office Hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our optional topic this month is going to be Unit Testing, led by Lamar Smith. Learn some of the tools, tricks, and reasons for writing effective unit tests. It might be more effort up front, but it will save you in the long run! Or bring any other questions you might have, projects you want help with, just come hang out.</p>

<h3 id="_java_off_heap">Java Off Heap</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Several members of the CJUG board have a podcast focused on Java news called Java Off Heap, and you can find it in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/javapubhouse-off-heaps-podcast/id985064111?mt=2">iTunes</a> or <a href="http://www.javaoffheap.com/">javaoffheap.com</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="http://www.javaoffheap.com/2018/09/episode-36-jakarta-ee-elections-make.html">Episode 36</a>: So another company made the exclusive trillion dollar club (AAPL). We also have Jakarta EE Election Results! (We presume there was no Russian Interference&#8230;&#8203;yet ;). Hear what it means with the new leadership, and who is conspicuously absent from the table. For IDE Buffs, we dived into both Eclipse and Netbeans releases (Eclipse Photon, and Netbeans 9)&#8230;&#8203; so geeks rejoice! Lastly we take a tour on the current Docker Image landscape and what companies are doing for Java in that space.</p>
