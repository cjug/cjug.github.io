(Dec 12)</a></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a end-cap for the year we host Lighning talks, where the presenter&#8230;&#8203;is you!&#8230;&#8203; That&#8217;s right. If you ever thought about presenting (or if you just want to have some practice) then participate in our lighning talks. The format is 10 ~ 15 mins on a topic of your choice (can be anything), and then you show up and present! It&#8217;s a safe environment for you to practice and help manage those presentation shivers (we can coach you too!). Here at CJUG we want to grow the next crop of presenters, so we are waiting for you!</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Chicago Java Users Group is run entirely by volunteers. It&#8217;s the community that makes it possible to have these events and get awesome speakers and do cool events. If you have participated as a attendee in our CJUG you know we strive to bring you great content and a great experience. How about volunteering? We always need more help, and the more help we have, the better our events! Volunteer can be as little or as much time as you can give. There is no real restriction to hop in and help us organize events. Also, volunteering allows you to connect directly to our company network (and sponsors) expanding who you know, and to top it off it looks great in your resume! So with all these upsides, come and help us! Just reach out to a CJUG Board member (or the M.C.) on any of our events and we&#8217;ll sign you up!</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reactive Programming is gaining a lot of excitement with multiple libraries available for different languages. What’s the reason for that, what has changed? In this presentation we will start with that question and learn about the problem that reactive programming aims to directly solve. Then we will dive into the programming abstraction and look at the various facilities available to create reactive applications. Along the way we will touch on practical applications that are already using the reactive programming model and some of the constraints and solutions that vary across different applications.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/ChicagoJUG/events/238468346/">Marcin Grzejszczak: Consumer-Driven Contracts and Your Microservice Architecture - May 23</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consumer driven contracts (CDC) are like TDD applied to the API. It’s especially important in the world of microservices. Since it’s driven by consumers, it’s much more user friendly. Of course microservices are really cool, but most people do not take into consideration plenty of potential obstacles that should be tackled. Then instead of frequent, fully automated deploys via a delivery pipeline, you might end up in an asylum due to frequent mental breakdowns caused by production disasters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will write a system using the CDC approach together with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud Contract verifier. I’ll show you how easy it is to write applications that have a consumer driven API and that will allow a developer to speed up the time of writing his better quality software.</p>

<p>And last but not the least, to wrap May off, we have
<a href="https://www.springdays.io/ehome/spring-days/chicago">Spring Days 2017 - Chicago - May 30-31</a>
Cloud computing ushered in a software renaissance, and while there has never been a better time to be a developer, technology evolves at an overwhelming speed. Spring has never been more relevant, but is also rapidly advancing - adding flexibility to the programming model for cloud-native, reactive and functional workloads. Over the course of 2 days, the community will share presentations and participate in open discussions about all things Spring. Don’t miss this opportunity to learn from and share with members of the Spring community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://spring.io/team/mminella">Michael Minella</a>, Spring Team member speaking on Cloud Native Batch Processing
This talk will explore the latest release of Spring Batch as well as how to utilize it in a modern cloud environment. We will work through building a cloud native batch process using Spring’s stack including Spring Batch, Spring Cloud Task, and other cloud tools as well as dive into what makes developing batch processes for the cloud both attractive as well as easy!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://spring.io/team/jlong">Josh Long</a>, Spring Team member, with <a href="https://pivotal.io/advocates">Mark Heckler</a> presenting Reactive Spring
Spring 5 is almost here! One of the most exciting introductions in this release is support for reactive programming, building on Pivotal&#8217;s Project Reactor to support message-driven, elastic, resilient, and responsive services. Spring 5 integrates an MVC-like component model adapted to support reactive processing and a new type of web endpoint, functional reactive endpoints. In this talk, we&#8217;ll look at the net-new Netty-based web runtime and how to integrate it with existing Spring-stack technologies.</p>

<p>Hello CJUG-ers!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I hope your year has been shaping up well so far with all the amazing tech events in the city. I’m thrilled, as the new Community Leader for Chicago Java Users Group, to be sending out an update for all the exciting meetups we have planned. Just as a quick retrospective, so far we’ve had great speakers to start off our year, eg. Paul Naumann gave a talk on Building a Better JVM couple of weeks ago, Bob Paulin and Michael Minella talked about Breaking Into Open Source. Hopefully you’ve also had a chance to mingle with the speakers at one of the after-meetup-drinks too!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also encourage you to take the survey for the topics you’d like to see speakers talk on. You can vote for Johan Andrén to speak on Akka Clustering or Akka Streaming and Alpakka.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We want to get attendees more involved with the community. Feel free to find one of us Board Members at a meetup and we can explore ideas together on how to get you more connected with the community and/or with mentors/mentees. Participating in Office Hours is also a great way to engage with engineers who share your passion for all things Java/JVM! We’re also active in #java, #scala, #kotlin etc. on <a href="https://chicago-tech.slack.com">chicago-tech.slack.com</a></p>

<p>Need help with a project?  Would you like a second pair of eyes to dig into that tricky issue you’ve been facing?  Or do you just want to hang out with your laptop and some people after work?  We’ve got just the thing for you!  Introducing CJUG Office Hours!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Office Hours will be hosted after work.  Every session will have at least one aide in attendance for the full session.  The purpose of these sessions is similar to that of a ‘coffee and code’ - connecting with people who want to work on personal projects, get a code review, or just hang out.  There is no set format and you may come and go as you please.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In JDK 9, the JFR APIs will become supported, so you can now rely on the JFR APIs for both controlling Oracle Java Flight Recorder and introducing your own custom JFR data into the recordings. Also, with JDK 9, a new major, very different version of the Oracle Java Mission Control feature of Oracle Java SE Advanced will be released.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This session takes a sneak peek into what the new APIs for controlling the Oracle Java Flight Recorder feature will look like and provides migration guidelines from the old APIs. It also goes through some of the highlights of the completely redesigned Oracle Java Mission Control 6.0.0, such as the automatic analysis of flight recordings.</p>

<p>Introduction to Machine Learning for Java Developers</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Machine Learning (ML) is a powerful data analytics tool that essentially allows machines to solve problems without explicit programming. ML is used in search, marketing, adaptive websites, online advertising, stock market analysis, and even inside of IDE&#8217;s.  Google&#8217;s CEO, Sundar Pichai, has said his company is betting big on advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in the coming years.  Tim Cook from Apple stated "Today, machine learning drives improvement in countless features across our products”.  At Microsoft&#8217;s Ignite conference, CEO Satya Nadella talked about his vision for how deep learning and AI will transform the company.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But what exactly is ML?  How is it different from the previous AI technology cycle?  What use cases are suitable for ML?  And most importantly, how can we Java developers take advantage of ML in our applications?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll take a look at the various ML services and tools available to Java developers.  In particular we&#8217;ll explore the Watson Java SDK to demonstrate some powerful ML functionality on a mobile device.  Also, we&#8217;ll discuss the details of an exciting, proposed JSR for visual recognition.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bring your project and run it on Java 9 EA with fellow CJUG members! See if the performance improvements Charlie and Heather did a hack day for us in April 2016.  Java 9 is targeted for release for July 2017 but that doesn&#8217;t mean you need to wait until next year to understand how the new features might benefit your projects. Charlie will be there for anything that breaks (no pressure). Also learn how to take part in Java technology evolution through the Java Community Process (JCP) program run by Heather VanCura. You can participate as an individual, corporation, or nonprofit such as a Java user group (JUG). This session gives you step-by-step instructions on how to participate in the JCP Program with the new membership levels. You will also learn about the global Adopt-a-JSR program and how you can participate in the Adopt-a-JSR program through CJUG. Find out how you have contribute to the future editions of the Java Standard and Java Enterprise Editions.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s the a new year, and is an exciting year for CJUG</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>2016 may have been a rocky year in general, but we know it actually rocked for CJUG! We cross 2000 members in our Meetup page, had great presenters from Simon Ritter, to Arun Gupta, and Markus Eisele! We also have new local talent stepping up and presenting (like Andres Olarte) and we have more brave souls coming to Lightning talks. We also have cross-pollination events with the Python and Ruby community (and throw some lit parties this year). In all CJUG flourished this past year!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So this year is going to be even more ambitious! In terms of leadership Bob Paulin is stepping down as the President (don&#8217;t worry, he&#8217;s now our CFO, ah, term limits) and after voting I was given the honor of leading the organization for a year (as far as we know no russian hacking involved :).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So in all, CJUG sports new leadership, and as President, I promise that this is the year of great expansion. We want to get YOU more involved and we are planning on doing even more events and activites to make sure that Chicago is still THE place to be a Java Technologist. CJUG wants you to be exposed to all of our tech companies here in Chicago, and to be a geek with everyone in our community!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In that vein, meet all of our new leadership</p>

<p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/ChicagoJUG/events/237330029/">Josh Juneau and Bob Paulin present: Adopt-a-JSR (ONLINE ONLY) (Feb 15th)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Java EE 8 is under active development, and JDK 9 is now feature complete.  There are many areas in which the community can contribute to each of these efforts. Adopt-a-JSR is a grassroots initiative developed by JUG leaders to encourage JUG members to get involved in a JSR. The CJUG has adopted JSR 366: Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 8 (Java EE 8 Specification, and we plan to help make a difference in the future of Java EE! We have also adopted JSR 379 (Java SE 9 Platform Umbrella), and we’re furthering our involvement by working on OpenJDK initiatives in this session.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Paul Nauman presents: Building a Better JVM (Feb 28th)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this session we’ll examine the case for building an open-source Java Virtual Machine (JVM) in Java. We’ll look at a brief history of some previous disruptive technologies. We’ll consider what a JVM does and how it works, and we’ll discuss some of the indications that existing implementations are problematic. Then we’ll look at some examples of JVMs written in Java and the implementation challenges of such an approach. Finally we’ll consider a fledgling project that could serve to start this transition.</p>
